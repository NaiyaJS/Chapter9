# Chapter9
 a constructor is a special type of method within a class that is responsible for initializing objects of that class.
# for Cake Exercise- 
Can't figure out why Cake Flavor is null keep going in circles trying to fix bugs when I try to set a cake flavor.

# Reading Notes Chapters 3 and 4
Cannot store objects in a variable, use variables to identify where objects are in memory(<br>)
constructors are methods that create rules for creating objects from a class(<br>)
super() constructor is run before subclass constructor(<br>)

If you declare a method to return a value, you must return a value of the declared type(<br>)
or a value that is compatible with the declared type(<br>)
make the instance variable private ( private int size;)(<br>)
make the getter methods public (<br>)
( public void getSize()(<br>)
{return size;} (<br>)

public void setSize( int s )(<br>)
{size = s;})(<br>)

#Local variables do not get a default value. (<br>)
compiler compains if you try to use a local variable BEFORE the variable is initialized (<br>)


#A class can have any number of:
instance variables, getter, setter, method(<br>)

#A method can only have one of these 
return

#This can be implicitly promoted
return, argument

#I prefer my instance variables private
encapslation

#it really means 'make a copy'
pass by value

#Only setters should be updated
instance variable

#A Method can have many of these
arguments

#I return something
getter

#I shouldnt be used with instance variables
public

#I can have many arguments
method

#By definition, I take on argument
setter

#These help create encapslation
getter, setter, public, private

#I always fly solo
reurn
