# Chapter9
 a constructor is a special type of method within a class that is responsible for initializing objects of that class.
# for Cake Exercise- 
Can't figure out why Cake Flavor is null keep going in circles trying to fix bugs when I try to set a cake flavor.

# Reading Notes Chapters 3 and 4
Cannot store objects in a variable, use variables to identify where objects are in memory<br>
constructors are methods that create rules for creating objects from a class<br>
super() constructor is run before subclass constructor<br>

If you declare a method to return a value, you must return a value of the declared type<br>
or a value that is compatible with the declared type<br>
make the instance variable private ( private int size;)<br>
make the getter methods public <br>
( public void getSize()<br>
{return size;} <br>

public void setSize( int s )<br>
{size = s;})<br>

#Local variables do not get a default value. <br>
compiler compains if you try to use a local variable BEFORE the variable is initialized <br>


**#A class can have any number of:**<br>
instance variables, getter, setter, method<br>

#**A method can only have one of these** <br>
return<br>

#**This can be implicitly promoted**<br>
return, argument<br>

#**I prefer my instance variables private**<br>
encapslation<br>

#**it really means 'make a copy'**<br>
pass by value<br>

#**Only setters should be updated**<br>
instance variable<br>

#**A Method can have many of these**<br>
arguments<br>

#**I return something**<br>
getter<br>

#**I shouldnt be used with instance variables**<br>
public<br>

#**I can have many arguments**(br>
method<br>

#**By definition, I take on argument**<br>
setter<br>

#**These help create encapsulation**
getter, setter, public, private

#**I always fly solo**<br>
return<br>
